G'day G'day mates, ~~Lazarbeam~~ Jony Here! I'ma tell ya a bit bout myself...


So... my name is Jonathan. I'm 14 years old. I'm a full time dev that absolutely loves scaring people ( not a scary thing, but, still good to listen to! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbxgYlcNxE8&feature=youtu.be&t=850 ), and I code in ~~more languages than you can even count~~assembly,Lua, js, html, css, python, C, C++, C#, ts, vue ( I consider it a language, not a **framework** ), xent, php, sql, and a couple others ( my own custom projects for special executables, One is gonna be released in about 6 weeks! ).

So, that 'bout raps up me, so, why not go say hello and follow me! I got some good projects coming soon!
